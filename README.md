# CILogon Discovery Service Skin

## Usage

This is the CADRE CSS theme of CILogon pages for their platform authentication. The key file in this repository is cadre.css, which is given to CILogon to embed in the pages they serve. Customise the cadre.css file for your community.

The other files are designed for enabling a development preview by including HTML, CSS, image, and JS assets usually provided by CILogon. To preview the theme, open index.html in a browser. The me.html also simulates the /me path for resetting cookies and other tasks.

The CSS is accessible in a number of ways, typically using the `?skin=value`

For example:
https://cilogon.org/?skin=access

https://cilogon.org/?skin=biocommons

https://dev.cilogon.aaf.edu.au/?skin=cadre

https://cilogon.org/?skin=illinois

https://cilogon.org/?skin=lsst

https://cilogon.org/?skin=ncsa
